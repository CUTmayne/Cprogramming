Lab3

An integer X is a divisor of another integer Y if X divides Y "evenly;" 
that is, Y % X is 0. A integer is prime if it is 2 or greater and its only 
divisors are 1 and itself. 

In this lab, you are to write a C program that, when completed, will
compute whether a number is prime. If the input number is prime, 
it will say it has 0 divisors and the number is prime. Otherwise, 
the program will print the divisors (except 1 and the number itself) and the total number of divisors.

Sample run 1:
______________

Enter a number: 24

2
3
4
6
8
12

Number 24 has 6 divisors

Sample run 2:
_________________

Enter a number: 23

Number 23 has 0 divisors
This number is prime
