Problem Description:

An example of arithmetic progression would be a series of integers (which we 
will call terms) like:

	3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, ...


Note that 3 is the first term, 7 is the second term, 11 is the 3rd term, 
etc.  4 is the common difference between any two consecutive terms.  Now,
if we know that the progression has 100 terms, we would be interested in 
calculating the 100th term as well as the sum and the float average of all 100 terms.

The following formulas can be used to calculate these items:

    LastTerm = FirstTerm + (NumberOfTerms - 1) x CommonDifference

    Sum of all terms = NumberOfTerms x (FirstTerm + LastTerm) / 2

    Average of all terms = (Sum of all terms) / NumberOfTerms

The program should adhere to the following pseudocode:

    1.  Prompt for and read the first term
    2.  Prompt for and read the common difference
    3.  Prompt for and read the number of terms
    4.  Calculate the last term (see formula above)
    5.  Calculate the sum of all the terms (see formula above)
    6.  Calculate the average of all the terms (see formula above)
    7.  Display the results
	
Your program must match the following sample run (between the lines of
dashes). Note that the 3, 3, and 100 on the first three lines were 
entered by the user.

You should also check results for other set of inputs as well.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter first term: 3
Enter common difference: 3
Enter number of terms: 100

The last term is 300
The sum of all the terms is 15150
The average of all the terms is 151.5
