Write a C program to compute and print Fibonacci values for some integers. You can assume that all input numbers are positive integers.

The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:

The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1.  Any Fibonacci number after the first two numbers is the sum of its two predecessors.

The Fibonacci numbers can be listed as the following sequence:

        1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

It is clear that the first two Fibonacci numbers are 1, the third is 2,the fourth is 3, the tenth is 55, and so on.

Here are some sample runs: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample 1:
Enter an integer: 11
The Fibonacci value for 11 is 89

Sample 2:
Enter an integer: 4
The Fibonacci value for 4 is 3

Sample 3:
Enter an integer: 9
The Fibonacci value for 9 is 34

Sample 4:
Enter an integer: 34
The Fibonacci value for 34 is 5702887

Sample 5:
Enter an integer: 1
The Fibonacci value for 1 is 1

Sample 6:
Enter an integer: 20
The Fibonacci value for 20 is 6765

                            Where the result is rounded to the nearest 
                            integer value.
                            
                            Because n is assumed to be positive, I omit 
                            part of the formula.
                            
                            Had a margin of error so it was commented out
